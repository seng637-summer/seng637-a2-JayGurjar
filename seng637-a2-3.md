**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">SENG 637 GROUP 3</span>**


**Detailed Description of testing strategy**

The testing approach chosen by our group was the black-box test case design technique. Black box testing essentially means testing the code without knowing how the code is written. Test cases in Range are listed below and the chosen range was 0 and 1: 



1. contains():
    1. containsShouldNotBeNan(): The method should return false as the range is a valid range with both arguments as numbers.
    2. containsShouldNotBeNegativeOne(): should return false as the range doesn’t include negative one. 
    3. containsshouldShouldBeZeroPointFive(): should return true as 0.5 is in between 0 and 1. \

2. constrain():
    1. constrainShouldBeZeroPointFive(): should return 0.5 as 0.5 is the mid value between 0 and 1
    2. constrainShouldBeOne() : Should return 1 as one 1 is closest to Postive infinity.
    3. constrainShouldBeNan(): should return Nan as Nan is passed as an argument. \

3. intersects():
    1. intersectShouldNotBeInBetweenNegativeTwoAndNegativeOne(): should return false as exampleRange does not contain the given arguments.
    2.  intersectsShouldNotBeInBetweenOneAndOnePointOne (): should return false as exampleRange does not contain the given arguments.
    3. intersectsShouldBeInBetweenZeroPointFiveAndZeroPointSix(): should return true as example range contains the given points. \

4. combine():
    1. combineShouldBeNull(): should return null as the null to null range is null
    2. combineShouldBeEqualTor1(): should return null as the null to null range is null
    3. combineTestCase(): should be true since the range is still NaN \

5. isNanRange():
    1. isNaNRangeShouldBeTrue(): should return true as Double.NaN is in the NaN range
    2. isNaNRangeShouldBeFalse(): should return false as 1.0 and 2.0 range is not in the NaN range
    3. isNaNRangeShouldBeInNaNRange(): should return false as 2.0 and Double.NaN range is not in the NaN range

We tried testing boundary conditions without knowing how the code was written to find a case where the code crashed. We passed in NaNs and infinities but the code was really well written and Range did not produce any failed unit tests. 

DataUtilities Class Methods tested (20 total test cases)

For the DataUtilities method, we created a total of 20 test cases, 18 of which passed and 2 failed. The 2 failed unit tests were testing against illegal arguments and were handled with illegal argument exceptions.



1. createNumberArray(double[ ]): Number[ ]
    1. createNumberArrayWrongType(): Throws an exception for null values
    2. NumberArrayTestBoundary(): Used to test edge values, i.e -1e10 ti 1e10.
2. createNumberArray2D(double[ ] [ ] data): Number[ ][ ]
    1. createNumberArray2DTest(): Used to validate 2D array creation
    2. createNumberArray2DTestSmall(): Used to validate 2D 1x1 array 
    3. createNumberArray2DTestNull(): Used to validate null/empty 2D array
    4. createNumberArray2DTestBoundary(): Used to test edge values, i.e -1e10 to 1e10.
3. calculateColumnTotal(Values2D, int):double
    1. calculateColumnTotalnegBoundary(): Used to test negative boundaries
    2. calculateColumnTotalposBoundary(): Used to test positive boundaries
    3. calculateColumnTotalInvalidIndex(): checks for invalid column index, fail
    4. calculateColumnTotalBlank(): Checks for empty columns
4. calculateRowTotal(Values2D, int):double
    1. calculateRowTotalBlank() : Checks for empty rows
    2. calculateRowTotalInvalidIndex(): Validates invadid row indices, fail
    2. calculateRowTotalposBoundary(): Used to test positive boundaries	
    3. calculateRowTotalnegBoundary(): Used to test negative boundaries
5. Clone
    1. cloneTestEmpty(); Validate an empty clone
    2. cloneTest(); Validate a cloning function
    3. cloneTestNull: Test null inputs
6. Equal
    1. EqualCheckTest
    2. EqualCheckPopulatedTest
    3. EqualCheckNotPopulatedTest

**Discussion TeamWork and Lessons Learned**

We decided that three of us would be on the Range and the other two on Data Utilities. Each pair of teams completed the 15 test cases for each category. Each team later checked on each other to ensure the test cases were satisfactory and we also asked each other questions throughout the process. We learned that dividing group work into teams and checking on each other works really well for us and allows us to complete the assignments easily and quickly. 

**Difficulties Encountered **

We had lots of trouble following the instructions for setting up the project since the instructions were not clear. Also, we were unsure what naming conventions we should follow and the naming got to be a little weird for some test cases. Also finding boundary test cases for some Range test cases was difficult especially since we did not know how the code was written. Finally, we also had difficulty running the Data Utility test cases provided by the professor and got errors when we initially ran them. Eventually, we found out what was wrong with the file and fixed it.

**Comments/Feedback**

In the lab, we got the chance to learn more about test cases and how it's essential to write good names for test cases especially.
